# number-classifier
### by Luke Doughty <luke.doughty@me.com>

Handwritten number classifier neural network with gui so users can test the model on their own handwritten numbers.
I am making this to learn how to make deep learning models using pytorch and practice making gui's and event driven programming on a three tiered architecture.
