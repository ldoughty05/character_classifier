# number-classifier
### by Luke Doughty <luke.doughty@me.com>

Handwritten number classifier neural network with gui so users can test the model on their own handwritten numbers.
I am making this to learn how to make deep learning models using pytorch and practice making gui's and event driven programming on a three tiered architecture.

## Installation
1. clone repository with "git clone git@github.com:ldoughty05/character_classifier.git"
2. To train a new model, run the main() method of classifier.py. Make sure that TRAINING_NEW_MODEL = True. Set it equal to false to evaluate the model without the gui.
3. Start the GUI by running main.py
