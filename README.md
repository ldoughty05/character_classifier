# number-classifier
### by Luke Doughty <luke.doughty@me.com>

Handwritten number classifier neural network with gui so users can test the model on their own handwritten numbers.
I am making this to learn how to make deep learning models using pytorch and practice making gui's and event driven programming.

This repository also includes fashion.py which is just the pytorch quickstart tutorial.
